library("ggpubr")

Computing a one-way ANOVA test

We want to know if there is any significant difference between the average weights of plants in the 3 experimental conditions.

```{r}
# Compute the analysis of variance
res.aov <- aov(weight ~ group, data = my_data)
res.aov
```

```{r}
# Summary of the analysis
summary(res.aov)
```

Interpreting the result of one-way ANOVA tests
```{r}
As the p-value is less than the significance level 0.05, we can conclude that there are significant differences between the groups highlighted with â€œ*" in the model summary.
```

Multiple pairwise-comparison between the means of groups(This is to determine if the mean difference between specific pairs of group are statistically significant.)
we are using Tukey multiple pairwise-comparisons
```{r}

TukeyHSD(res.aov)

```
diff: difference between means of the two groups
lwr, upr: the lower and the upper end point of the confidence interval at 95% (default)
p adj: p-value after adjustment for the multiple comparisons.

Interpreting the Results
It can be seen from the output, that only the difference between trt2 and trt1 is significant with an adjusted p-value of 0.012.
```{r}

```
